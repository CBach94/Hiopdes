# Hiopdes
HIgh Order Partial Differential Equations Solver framework.
This framework can solve PDEs using galerkin spectral methods.
Currently, following equations can be solves:
- Laplace equation (1D/2D/3D)
- Poisson equation (1D/2D/3D)
- Advection-Diffusion equation (1D/2D/3D)

# Prerequisites
To use the framework you will need
- Armadillo
- Cmake
- GCC

To use the Post-Processing scripts you can use Matlab or Octave.
